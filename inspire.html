        <h2>Empire Maker</h2>
        <p>There are only a handful of individuals throughout history who are household names, George Washington, Julius Caeser, and Napolean Bonaparte come to mind. Alexander the Great is one of these few.</p>
        <p>While most people consider Alexander the Great to be a great conqueror, he was more than that. He bridged the gaps in culture all throughout the areas he campaigned in. He united Greece into almost a single state, Hellenized Egypt and went as far as India. He would even go as far as to be admired by many great romans such as Julius Caeser and Emperor Augustus, and would have a lasting impact on many cultures for centuries to come.</p>
