      <h1>Comical Things Perhaps</h1>
      <p>Some of these things I think are amusing probably.</p>

      <h2>Something About the Music....</h2>
      <p>A light youtube short that I thought was funny the first time I saw it.</p>
      <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/vYud9sZ91Mc?si=ZJwq2ExkKZj49ot-">Star Wars</a>

      <h2>Goku Super Saiyan 3</h2>
      <p>I found this website when trying to find the lines of Goku going Super Saiyan 3, the comments on the post had mixed reactions that I found funny since I didn't really understand.</p>

      <h2>Klay World Videos</h2>
      <p>Klay world is now something that is considered to be "old", I remember back in the day when I first stumbled upon these videos on youtube. Maybe a little graphic for some people despite the characters being faceless blob people. </p>
