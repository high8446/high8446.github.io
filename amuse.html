  <h1>Comical Things Perhaps</h1>
  <p>Some of these things I think are amusing probably.</p>

  <h2>Something About the Music....</h2>
  <p>A light youtube short that I thought was funny the first time I saw it.</p>
  <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/vYud9sZ91Mc?si=ZJwq2ExkKZj49ot-">Star Wars</a>

  <h2>Goku Super Saiyan 3</h2>
  <p>I found this website when trying to find the lines of Goku going Super Saiyan 3, the comments on the post had mixed
    reactions that I found funny since I didn't really understand.</p>
  <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/youre-going-to-love-this-trust-me.134048/">Goku SSJ3</a>

  <h2>Klay World Videos</h2>
  <p>Klay world is now something that is considered to be "old", I remember back in the day when I first stumbled upon
    these videos on youtube. Maybe a little graphic for some people despite the characters being faceless blob people.
